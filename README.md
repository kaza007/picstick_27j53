# picstick_27j53
PIC18F27J53 Pinguino compatible USB stick

Background
------------

The picstick_27j53 is a small PCB that can be connected directly into a USB connector. It is based on the [LeoStick (Arduino Compatible)](http://www.freetronics.com.au/products/leostick#.VWqnws-qpHw) form factor and the hardware is identical to the [PIC18F47J53 Pinguino](http://wiki.pinguino.cc/index.php/PIC18F47J53_Pinguino) except that the 28pin PIC is used instead of the 40pin.

The picstick_27j53 was created to add to the ever growing choice of PIC alternatives to Arduino. There are no surface mount components, so the picstick_27j53 is easy to build.

Construction
-----------------

PIC Bootloader
-----------------
The PIC18F27J53 must be programmed with the Pinguino Bootloader as described in the Pinguino [Basics](http://wiki.pinguino.cc/index.php/Basics#Bootloader) page.
